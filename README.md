# node-websockets-poc
This proof of concept contains an Express app and a Websocket app. 

This POC is an example of slow apis, as Websocket app simulates a delay of 10.000ms in the api response.

## Getting started
Run `node ws-server` and check the response in the Client side.

The Client can be found at: https://github.com/KoolTheba/react-websockets-poc
